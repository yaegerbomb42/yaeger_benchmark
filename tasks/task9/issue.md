# Task 9: Secure File Storage System

## Problem Description

Implement a secure, scalable file storage system with client-side encryption, deduplication, versioning, and fine-grained access controls for enterprise document management.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Client-side encryption with key management
- File deduplication and compression
- Version control and change tracking
- Hierarchical access controls (users, groups, roles)
- Audit logging and compliance features

### Performance Requirements
- **Upload**: 100MB/s sustained upload speed
- **Download**: 200MB/s sustained download speed
- **Latency**: <100ms for metadata operations
- **Storage**: Efficient space utilization with dedup

## Key Components

1. **Encryption**: AES-256 with key derivation
2. **Deduplication**: Content-based chunking
3. **Access Control**: RBAC with inheritance
4. **Audit**: Comprehensive activity logging

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Correctness (70%)**: Data integrity, access controls
- **Performance (20%)**: Upload/download speeds
- **Security (10%)**: Encryption implementation, key management
