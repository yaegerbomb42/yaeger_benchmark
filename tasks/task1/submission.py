Trading Algorithm Implementation

Implement your high-frequency trading algorithm here.
Your solution will be assessed on:
1. Profitability (primary metric)
2. Latency (<100ms per decision)
3. Risk management
4. Code quality and robustness

API Usage:
- exchange.get_quote(symbol) -> Quote
- exchange.place_order(order) -> OrderResult
- exchange.get_positions() -> Dict[str, Position]
- market_data.get_latest_price(symbol) -> float
- portfolio.can_buy/can_sell() -> bool

# Advanced Strategy Ideas to Consider:
#
# 1. Mean Reversion:
#    - Calculate rolling mean and standard deviation
#    - Buy when price is below mean - 2*std
#    - Sell when price is above mean + 2*std
#
# 2. Momentum Trading:
#    - Detect breakouts from trading ranges
#    - Follow strong directional moves
#    - Use stop-losses for risk management
#
# 3. Pairs Trading:
#    - Find correlated assets
#    - Trade the spread when it deviates from mean
#    - Market-neutral strategy
#
# 4. Market Making:
#    - Provide liquidity by placing limit orders
#    - Profit from bid-ask spread
#    - Manage inventory risk
#
# 5. Statistical Arbitrage:
#    - Use statistical models to predict short-term prices
#    - Trade based on probability distributions
#    - High-frequency, low-risk trades
#
# Remember to:
# - Always check portfolio.can_buy() and portfolio.can_sell()
# - Monitor latency and optimize for speed
# - Implement proper error handling
# - Test with different market conditions
