Task 4: Distributed Cache System Implementation

TODO: Implement a distributed caching system with Redis-like functionality,
fault tolerance, and strong consistency guarantees.

Key requirements:
- Distributed key-value storage with partitioning
- Automatic replication and consistency
- 100,000+ operations/second per node
- <5ms cache hits, <50ms cache misses
- Automatic failover and cluster membership
