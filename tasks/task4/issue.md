# Task 4: Distributed Cache System

## Problem Description

Design a distributed caching system that provides Redis-like functionality with built-in fault tolerance, automatic failover, and strong consistency guarantees across multiple nodes.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Distributed key-value storage with partitioning
- Automatic replication and consistency
- Cache eviction policies (LRU, TTL)
- Cluster membership and failure detection
- Support for complex data types (strings, lists, sets, hashes)

### Performance Requirements  
- **Throughput**: 100,000+ operations/second per node
- **Latency**: <5ms for cache hits, <50ms for cache misses
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with automatic failover
- **Scalability**: Support 3-10 node clusters

## Key Features

1. **Consistent Hashing**: Distribute data across nodes
2. **Replication**: Configurable replication factor
3. **Consensus**: Raft algorithm for leader election
4. **Monitoring**: Health checks and metrics

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Correctness (70%)**: Data consistency, fault tolerance
- **Performance (20%)**: Operations per second, latency
- **Security (10%)**: Access control, data integrity
