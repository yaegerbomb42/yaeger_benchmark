# Task 5: ML Model Serving API

## Problem Description

Build a production-ready machine learning model serving API that supports multiple models, A/B testing, auto-scaling, and comprehensive monitoring with sub-100ms inference latency.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Multi-model serving with versioning
- A/B testing framework for model comparison
- Auto-scaling based on load
- Feature preprocessing pipelines
- Batch and real-time inference

### Performance Requirements
- **Latency**: <100ms for inference requests
- **Throughput**: 1,000+ requests/second per model
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with rolling deployments
- **Scalability**: Auto-scale from 1-20 instances

## Key Components

1. **Model Registry**: Version and metadata management
2. **Inference Engine**: Optimized model execution
3. **A/B Testing**: Traffic splitting and metrics
4. **Monitoring**: Performance and drift detection

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Correctness (70%)**: Accurate predictions, proper A/B testing
- **Performance (20%)**: Inference latency and throughput
- **Security (10%)**: Model protection, input validation
