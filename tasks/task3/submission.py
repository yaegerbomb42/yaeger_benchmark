Task 3: Dynamic Data Pipeline Implementation

TODO: Implement a high-performance data pipeline that processes 1M+ records/second
with real-time aggregations and sub-second query response times.

Key requirements:
- Stream processing for JSON data
- Real-time aggregations (sum, avg, count, percentiles) 
- Time-window calculations (1min, 5min, 1hour)
- <1 second query latency
- <2GB memory usage
