# Task 8: Real-Time Analytics Engine

## Problem Description

Build a real-time analytics engine that processes event streams, maintains sliding window aggregations, and provides sub-second query responses for business intelligence dashboards.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Stream processing with exactly-once semantics
- Sliding window aggregations (tumbling, hopping, session)
- Complex event processing and pattern detection
- Multi-dimensional OLAP cube generation
- Real-time alerting and anomaly detection

### Performance Requirements
- **Throughput**: 500,000+ events/second
- **Latency**: <500ms for query responses
- **Windows**: Support 1sec to 24hour windows
- **Memory**: Efficient memory usage for large windows

## Key Features

1. **Stream Processor**: Apache Kafka-style event processing
2. **Query Engine**: SQL-like interface for analytics
3. **Alerting**: Real-time threshold monitoring
4. **Visualization**: Dashboard integration APIs

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Correctness (70%)**: Accurate aggregations, event ordering
- **Performance (20%)**: Processing throughput, query latency
- **Security (10%)**: Data privacy, access controls
