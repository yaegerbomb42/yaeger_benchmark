Task 8: Real-Time Analytics Engine Implementation

TODO: Build real-time analytics engine with stream processing,
sliding window aggregations, and sub-second query responses.

Key requirements:
- Stream processing with exactly-once semantics
- Sliding window aggregations (tumbling, hopping, session)
- Complex event processing and pattern detection
- 500,000+ events/second throughput
- <500ms query response time
