# YAEGER BENCHMARK V2.0: EXTREME DIFFICULTY UPGRADE

## ðŸ”¥ PROBLEM ANALYSIS
Current tasks are being solved by ALL AIs with 100/100 scores:
- Grok AI: 100/100 
- Qwen 32B: 100/100
- Others: Also acing it

**Root Cause**: Tasks are too straightforward, lacking sufficient complexity layers

## ðŸŽ¯ NEW DIFFICULTY REQUIREMENTS

### MINIMUM COMPLEXITY STANDARDS:
1. **Multi-Stage Dependencies**: Each task requires 3-5 interdependent components
2. **Hidden Edge Cases**: Subtle requirements only revealed through deep testing
3. **Performance Constraints**: Sub-millisecond latencies, memory limits
4. **Real-World Chaos**: Network failures, race conditions, Byzantine faults
5. **Domain Expertise**: Requiring deep knowledge of specific fields
6. **Algorithmic Innovation**: No existing solutions, novel approaches needed
